description: >-
  **Player ID**. *Example: `185629`*. You can call by player ID. The API responds
  with the exact result. You can include multiple
  players in this parameter &mdash; just separate them by commas. The limit of
  players is 20. *Note: A single ID counts as a one API call. So, if you have
  players IDs, it's treated as 3 API calls.*
